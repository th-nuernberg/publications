This represents a new, more intuitive way of for example virtually exploring unknown spaces in advance. Our prototype consists of off-the-shelf VR components (i.e., treadmill, headphones, glasses, and controller) providing a simplified white cane simulation and was tested by six visually impaired subjects. Our results indicate that this interaction is yet difficult, but promising and an important step to make VR more and better usable for PVIs. As an impact on the CHI community, we would like to make this research field known to a wider audience by sharing our intermediate results and suggestions for improvements, on some of which we are already working on.},

In this paper, we suggest the exploration of virtual objects using o�-the-shelf VR game controllers. These are held like a pen with both hands and were used to palpate and identify the virtual object. Our study largely coincides with comparable previous work and shows that a ready-to-use VR system can be basically used for haptic exploration. The results indicate that virtual objects are more e�ectively recognized with closed eyes than with open eyes. In both cases, objects with a bigger morphological di�erence were identi�ed the most frequently. The limitations due to quality and quantity of tactile feedback should be tackled in future studies that utilize currently developed wearable haptic devices and haptic rendering involving all �ngers or even both hands. Thus, objects could be identi�able more intuitively and haptic feedback devices for interacting with virtual objects will be further disseminated.},

Some solutions integrate tracked devices which allow users to freely move within a certain space. Virtual 3D model can be visually explored, implemented collision detected allows users to get a feedback for instance by sound or vibration. For research projects there are several approaches which offer to get the actual feedback for the fingers of a hand, when the users virtually touches the surface of a 3D model. However, in the consumer market currently no product is sold which offers this direct feedback for the whole hand. In this paper we introduce a low-cost hand exoskeleton which is usable in conjunction with commodity hardware. It covers each of the five fingers of the user’s hand, its design is open-source, low-cost, can be customized and 3D printed by individuals. It aims at improving the haptic perception of users, bases of a popular physical computing platform and is designed to be assembled even by electronically unexperienced users. We show the integration of our lean interface of the wireless exoskeleton into exemplary VR environment and describe a calibration process which is flexible for customizations.},

In order to safely learn new routes in public space, however, a seeing trainer must assist the blind person. With the increasing availability of VR hardware, it is possible to transfer real spatial environments to virtual representations. The digitized environments can be used as a basis for this training without safety problems by real world hazards. This allows to cope with the limited resources of sighted assistants and enables blind people to become more independent. We propose to capture real public spaces (such as sidewalks, train stations etc.) and make them in this way ascertainable. Orientation and mobility can be trained in this digital model via multimodal sensory feedback while involving intuitive locomotion and white cane exploration. This paper sketches the related work and proposes our novel approach. Furthermore, we suggest additional improvements on our ongoing research.},

	abstract = {With Tangible User Interfaces, the computer user is able to interact in a fundamentally different and more intuitive way than with usual 2D displays. By grasping real physical objects, information can also be conveyed haptically, i.e., the user not only sees information on a 2D display, but can also grasp physical representations. To recognize such objects (“tangibles”) it is skillful to use capacitive sensing, as it happens in most touch screens. Thus, real objects can be located and identiﬁed by the touch screen display automatically. Recent work already addressed such capacitive markers, but focused on their coding scheme and automated fabrication by 3D printing. This paper goes beyond the fabrication by 3D printers and, for the ﬁrst time, applies the concept of capacitive codes to laser cutting and another immediate prototyping approach using modeling clay. Beside the evaluation of additional properties, we adapt recent research results regarding the optimized detection of tangible objects on capacitive screens. As a result of our comprehensive study, the detection performance is affected by the type of capacitive signal processing (respectively the device) and the geometry of the marker. 3D printing revealed to be the most reliable technique, though laser cutting and immediate prototyping of markers showed promising results. Based on our ﬁndings, we discuss individual strengths of each capacitive marker type.},

Ausgehend von dieser Entwicklung verschafft dieser Artikel einen Überblick über wesentliche Ansätze für die Erstellung von vielfältigen taktilen Materialen mittels 3D-Druckern. Er zeigt dabei insbesondere den Wandel von statischen zu interaktiven Ansätzen auf. Dabei muss bei Letzteren eine Kopplung zwischen den taktilen 3D-Drucken und elektronischen Entitäten erfolgen, welche durch unterschiedliche Sensorik umgesetzt werden kann. Zukünftige Entwicklungen könnten es erlauben, die Interaktion des Benutzers mit der kompletten Oberfläche von 3D-Drucken sensorisch zu erfassen und somit komplexe neue Interaktionsmöglichkeiten zu erschließen, welche blinden wie auch sehenden Menschen hilfreich sein können.},

In this paper we introduce a novel evaluation that examines the in�uence of di�erent types of haptic feedback on presence and performance regarding manual tasks in VR. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive user study involving 14 subjects, who performed throwing, stacking and object identi�cation tasks in VR with visual (i.e., sensory substitution), vibrotactile or force feedback. We measured the degree of presence and task-related performance metrics. Our results indicate that regarding presence vibrotactile feedback outperforms haptic feedback which performs better than visual feedback only. In addition, force feedback signi�cantly lowered the execution time for the throwing and the stacking task. In object identi�cation tasks, the vibrotactile feedback increased the detection rates compared to the vibrotactile and force feedback, but also increased the required time of identi�cation. Despite the inadequacies of the still young consumer technology, there were nevertheless strong indications of connections between presence, task ful�llment and the type of haptic feedback.},

Due to the complex manual manufacturing process there is still a lack of suitable models for the visually impaired. Millions of 3D models are currently available on the internet and can be searched by dedicated retrieval sites. Most of them can be printed by 3D printers; however, this often isn’t a trivial task even for sighted users. Blind peoples’ self-dependence could be drastically increased if they were able to autonomously print 3D models at home. This paper analyses the individual tasks to actually print 3D models and adapts them to steps accessible for blind people. We introduce a workflow for the combined use of 3D printing software and consumer hardware.

The labels in illustrations support mainly two search tasks: learners can determine the graphical reference objects of unknown terms or vice versa (i.e. get textual descriptions for unknown visual objects). In traditional print media, human illustrators often overload an illustration with many labels in order to reduce the printing costs. But such illustrations ignore the limitations of human cognitive processes. Based on the chunking principle, we argue, that interactive 3D visualizations should be carefully adopted to the current search tasks. Therefore, we consider semantical relations to select only those labels which are relevant for the current task and emphasize the associated graphical objects.

In addition, secondary elements (e. g., textual annotations or associated visualizations) are smoothly integrated into adapted 2D or 3D illustrations.

By integrating conductive elements into 3D printed tactile maps, they can be recognized by a single touch on the mobile device's display, which eases the handling for blind and visually impaired people. To allow multiple elevation levels in our transparent tactile maps, we conducted a study to reconcile technical and physiological requirements of off-the-shelf 3D printers, capacitive touch inputs and the human tactile sense. We propose an interaction concept for 3D printed audiovisual tactile maps, verify its feasibility and test it with a user study.

Today these models can be materialized by 3D printing, which is increasingly used at schools for people with visual impairments. In contrast to sighted people, people with visual impairments have so far, however, neither been able to search nor to print 3D models without assistance. This article describes our work to develop an aid for people with visual impairments that would facilitate autonomous searching for and printing of 3D models. In our initial study, we determined the requirements to accomplish this task by means of a questionnaire and developed a first approach that allowed personal computer-based 3D printing. An extended approach allowed searching and printing using common smartphones. In our architecture, technical details of 3D printers are abstracted by a separate component that can be accessed via Wi-Fi independently of the actual 3D printer used. It comprises a search of the models in an annotated database and 3D model retrieval from the internet. The whole process can be controlled by voice interaction. The feasibility of autonomous 3D printing for people with visual impairments is shown with a first user study. Our second user study examines the usability of the user interface when searching for 3D models on the internet and preparing them for the materialization. The participants were able to define important printing settings, whereas other printing parameters could be determined algorithmically.},

	abstract = {Tactile graphics play an essential role in knowledge transfer for blind people. The tactile exploration of these graphics is often challenging because of the cognitive load caused by physiological constraints and their complexity. The coupling of physical tactile graphics with electronic devices offers to support the tactile exploration by auditory feedback. Often, these systems have strict constraints regarding their mobility or the process of coupling both components. Additionally, visually impaired people cannot appropriately benefit from their residual vision. This article presents a concept for 3D printed tactile graphics, which offers to use audio-tactile graphics with usual smartphones or tablet-computers. By using capacitive markers, the coupling of the tactile graphics with the mobile device is simplified. These tactile graphics integrating these markers can be printed in one turn by off-the-shelf 3D printers without any post-processing and allows us to use multiple elevation levels for graphical elements. Based on the developed generic concept on visually augmented audio-tactile graphics, we presented a case study for maps. A prototypical implementation was tested by a user study with visually impaired people. All the participants were able to interact with the 3D printed tactile maps using a standard tablet computer. To study the effect of visual augmentation of graphical elements, we conducted another comprehensive user study. We tested multiple types of graphics and obtained evidence that visual augmentation may offer clear advantages for the exploration of tactile graphics. Even participants with a minor residual vision could solve the tasks with visual augmentation more quickly and accurately.},

	abstract = {In the past years car navigation systems have significantly developed. Beside many important features to support drivers the advanced graphics is the most visible part. After starting with simple arrows and numbers, maps were displayed in order to provide hints for the spatial orientation of the driver. Later on, those maps were rendered perspectively in bird’s eye view and finally 3D data was integrated to generate more realistic views using city models and terrain models. However, one drawback of these 3D navigation systems is the use of monoscopic displays. Using these displays, the only way to mediate spatial depth has been to facilitate monoscopic depth cues. Whereas for desktop computers stereoscopic displays are used in order to allow a better depiction of 3D scenes, they were not used for mobile navigation systems yet. Since this application field has specific characteristics and requirements, this paper addresses the challenges and perspectives for the use of (auto–) stereoscopic displays in prospective car navigation systems.},

Since travel demand models have been applied in particular for motorized traffic, only little is known about the influence of variables that affect both the choice of trip destination and the route decision in pedestrian and cycling models. In order to create urban spaces that encourage cycling and walking, we propose a VR (Virtual Reality) pedestrian simulator which involves walk-in-place locomotion. Thus, identical conditions are obtained for all subjects which is not feasible in real world field research with naturally varying environmental influences. As a first step, our qualitative and quantitative user study revealed that walking in a VR treadmill felt safest and most intuitive, although walking in it took in return more energy than walking-in-place with VR trackers only.},

To make this complexity advantageous, Smart Cities integrate intelligent sensors that communicate with each other and are invisible to citizens, so that they can offer additional services. Despite the fact that the inclusion of diverse citizens is an essential requirement of Smart Cities, Ambient Intelligence is often not considered under accessibility aspects. 
The central question in this context is how disadvantaged groups in particular can benefit from Smart Cities. It is extremely important for people with disabilities to be able to move autonomously in public spaces. For this purpose, however, people who are blind sometimes need to be able to ask other people for directions. Knowing whether people are present can be important information. In our exemplary case study, Ambient Intelligence is used for people with visual impairments, so that they can decide whether they want to go to this or an alternative place based on the information about the density of people in a place.},

However, it is difficult to determine in advance the exact needs of people with disabilities for concrete planning. Previous approaches mainly aimed at existing urban environments. Ideally, citizens should be directly involved in the planning process of buildings and urban environments. For existing urban environments, crowdsourcing approaches exist to obtain suggestions for improvement from citizens. We present a novel approach for the direct integration of wheelchair users in the urban environments to be planned (participatory urban development) in virtual reality. We present an easy-to-reproduce simulator that allows wheelchair users to directly explore the planned buildings and urban environments in a virtual, spatial environment. This means that these 3D models can be commented already in the planning phase and provide valuable information about accessibility.},

This must be taken into account when transforming urban environments into Smart Cities. On the one hand, general accessibility rules must be taken into account in the planning of buildings and urban environments. However, an essential requirement for transformation is the participation of citizens, i.e., concrete suggestions for improvement from citizen should be taken into account. Elderly people are a valuable source of information for improvements. Instead of simply involving them in the modification of existing facilities, our approach suggests that they should be included in the planning process. However, abstract plans and questionnaires allow only limited insights for ordinary citizen. Therefore, our approach aims at providing a suitable interface to interactively walk through and annotate virtual reality plans for buildings and city districts. We present a working prototype for elderly people based on 3D consumer hardware appropriate form of locomotion with which they can explore and annotate urban planning according to their individual needs.},

While overcoming physical objects\&rsquo; and spaces\&rsquo; limitations, virtual objects and environments that can be spatially explored have a particular benefit. To give readers a complete, clear and concise overview of current and past publications on touchable and walkable audio supplemented VR applications for blind and visually impaired users, this survey paper presents a high-level taxonomy to cluster the work done up to now from the perspective of technology, interaction and application. In this respect, we introduced a classification into small-, medium- and large-scale virtual environments to cluster and characterize related work. Our comprehensive table shows that especially grounded force feedback devices for haptic feedback (\&lsquo;small scale\&rsquo;) were strongly researched in different applications scenarios and mainly from an exocentric perspective, but there are also increasingly physically (\&lsquo;medium scale\&rsquo;) or avatar-walkable (\&lsquo;large scale\&rsquo;) egocentric audio-haptic virtual environments. In this respect, novel and widespread interfaces such as smartphones or nowadays consumer grade VR components represent a promising potential for further improvements. Our survey paper provides a database on related work to foster the creation process of new ideas and approaches for both technical and methodological aspects.},

In order to be able to implement specific measures, it is necessary to better understand and emphasize sustainable transportation like walking and cycling through focused research. When developing novel traffic concepts and urban spaces for non-motorized traffic participants like bicycles and pedestrians, traffic and urban planning must be focused on their needs. To provide rare qualitative factors (such as stress, the perception of time and attractiveness of the environment) in this context, we present an audiovisual VR bicycle simulator which allows the user to cycle through a virtual urban environment by physically pedaling and also steering. Virtual Reality (VR) is a suitable tool in this context, as study participants find identical and almost freely definable (virtual) urban spaces with adjustable traffic scenarios. Our preliminary prototype proved to be promising and will be further optimized and evaluated.},

@article{Zoppelt2019Grey,
 abstract = {Autonomous vehicles have a greater attack potential than any previous individual mobility vehicle. This is primarily due to the considerable communication demands of the vehicles, which on the one hand emerge for reasons of functionality and safety, and on the other hand for reasons of comfort. Driverless vehicles require communication interfaces to the environment, direct connections (e.g., Vehicle-to-X) and connections to an original equipment manufacturer backend service or a cloud. These communication connections could all be used as backdoors for attacks. Most existing countermeasures against cyber attacks, e.g., the use of message cryptography, concentrate on concrete attacks and do not consider the complexity of the various access options offered by modern vehicles. This is mainly due to a solution-oriented approach to security problems. The model- based technique SAM (Security Abstraction Model) adds to the early phases of (automotive) software architecture development by explicitly documenting attacks and managing them with the appropriate security countermeasures. It additionally estab- lishes the basis for comprehensive security analysis techniques, e.g., already available attack assessment methods. SAM thus contributes to an early, problem-oriented and solution-ignorant understanding combining key stakeholder knowledge. This paper provides a detailed overview of SAM and evaluates this security technology using interviews with industry experts and a grounded theory analysis. The resulting analyses of this evaluation show that SAM puts the security-by-design principle into practice by enabling collaboration between automotive system engineers, system architects and security experts. The application of SAM aims to reduce costs, improve overall quality and gain competitive advantages. Based on our evaluation results, SAM is highly suitable, comprehensible and complete to be used in the industry.},

 abstract = {Password-hardened encryption (PHE) was introduced by Lai et al. at USENIX 2018 and immediately productized by VirgilSecurity. PHE is a password-based key derivation protocol that involves an oblivious external crypto service for key derivation. The security of PHE protects against offline brute-force attacks, even when the attacker is given the entire database. Furthermore, the crypto service neither learns the derived key nor the password. PHE supports key-rotation meaning that both the server and crypto service can update their keys without involving the user. While PHE significantly strengthens data security, it introduces a single point of failure because key-derivation always requires access to the crypto service. In this work, we address this issue and simultaneously increase security by introducing threshold password-hardened encryption. Our formalization of this primitive revealed shortcomings of the original PHE definition that we also address in this work. Following the spirit of prior works, we give a simple and efficient construction using lightweight tools only. We also implement our construction and evaluate its efficiency. Our experiments confirm the practical efficiency of our scheme and show that it is more efficient than common memory-hard functions, such as scrypt. From a practical perspective this means that threshold PHE can be used as an alternative to scrypt for password protection and key-derivation, offering better security in terms of offline brute force attacks.},
